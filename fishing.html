<h2>Fishing in Southwest Virginia</h2>
    <p> Here is a picture of a smallmouth I caught last weekend with our fellow classmate, Chris!</p>

    <p>Smallmouth fishing is excellent here on the nearby New River. The river is the third oldest in the world and is home to a plentifull population of smallmouth, musky and even walleye!</p>
 

<h2> I love floating down the river and casting along the banks to catch these awesome and aggressive fish!</h2>
   <img alt="the river" class="responsive" src="river.jpg" />
<p> Smallmouth love to hide behind rocks near the rapids and wait for a bug or crawfish to pass by. I often paddle straight to the rapids and stand where I am in position to score a giant!</p>

 <h2> I also enjoy other types of fishing such as trout fishing and largemouth bass fishing! </h2>   
    <p>Southwest Virginia provides excellent trout fishing, as the temperatures remain cool enough to sustain a trout population! The Cascades waterfall and Little Stony Creek-- which flows into it--provide great opportunities to go Brook trout fishing. </p>

<h2> Where My Passion All Started</h2>
<p> Before I was even 5 years old, I was casting a fishing rod with my Dad. I grew up fishing the James River and local ponds in my neighborhood. Occasionally, my brothers, Dad and I would head to the Shenendoah River to catch smallmout. Since growing up, I have fished at least two times a week and now run a social media account called @RVAFISHREPORT to help keep the Richmond fishing community updated on the latest river conditions. Feel free to check out my account on Instagram. </p>
