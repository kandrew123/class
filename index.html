    <h1>Hello, classmates!</h1>

<img alt="andrew" src="Andrew.jpg" class="responsive" alt="andrew"/img>
        
<p>My name is Andrew Knight, and I am a second year communication master's student here at Virginia Tech.</p>
<p>I am currently working on my thesis, which studies how public relations communication changes in the gig/sharing economy. I am specifically looking at how the sharing economy relates to the relationship management theory and dialogic communication, as organizations must establish and manage both types of publics in order to be successful. </p>
<p> I am excited for this class because I am interested in how <strong>content management strategies </strong> can be used in <em>public relations firms </em> that are looking to build content stategy for clients' data. I also hope this class can help me understand the sharing economy more clearly with regard to increased internet capcities on mobile devices. </p>
<p> Finally, I hope to learn how I can better market my content management skills for a future career in content strategy and public relations. </p>
