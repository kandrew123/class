<h2>Lebron James Is My Hero</h2>
   <img alt="This is a picture of Lebron" src="Lebron.jpg" class="responsive" alt="lebron"/img/>
    <p>From his stellar on-court leadership and dominance as a 16-time All Star, to making the I Promise School--where he is helping at-risk children graduate and go to college--Lebron James exemplifies exactly what it means to shine in the spotlight and make the world better each day. </p>
        <p> I have been a Lebron fan ever since I first started playing basketball as a young kid, and I have tried to emulate his playing style on the court throughout my basketball career. My favorite part of his game is his ability to get to the basket no matter who is in the way. He drives really strong and that motivates me to have a similar mentality when trying to score. </p>
